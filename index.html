    <h3 id="general-weren-t-these-all-voted-down-in-the-last-agm-">General: Weren’t these all voted down in the last
        AGM?</h3>
    <p>More than two thirds of members present at the AGM voted in favour of enfranchisement in some way, despite the
        fact that it was an all-day meeting. Some newer members did not attend, on the assumption that they also
        couldn’t vote in the AGM.</p>
    <h3 id="sr1-sr3-why-three-months-why-not-zero-months-">SR1&amp;SR3: Why three months? Why not zero months?</h3>
    <p>Three months appears to be the best compromise position to maximise enfranchisement in the short term while
        satisfying members who are concerned about branch stacking.</p>
    <h3 id="sr2-if-election-deliberation-sessions-aren-t-compulsory-how-will-we-ensure-voters-are-informed-">SR2: If
        Election Deliberation Sessions aren’t compulsory, how will we ensure voters are informed?</h3>
    <p>The requirement to attend an EDS essentially worked as a voter suppression mechanism in the 2023 State Council
        elections.</p>
    <p>Of the 3809 total members during that election:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2740 members (72% of all members) satisfied the 1 year membership requirement.</li>
        <li>Only 671 members (17% of all members; 25% of 1y+ members) attended an EDS</li>
        <li>537 members (14% of all members; 19% of 1y+ members) voted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Members can be informed in all sorts of ways. Enfranchisement can only strengthen our democracy.</p>
    <h3
        id="sr4-5-won-t-removing-reducing-eligibility-requirements-risk-unqualified-people-being-elected-to-state-council-">
        SR4&amp;5: Won’t removing/reducing eligibility requirements risk unqualified people being elected to State
        Council?</h3>
    <p>Membership length is not a reliable proxy for skills, experience, or even dedication to the Party. It is poor
        governance to arbitrarily prevent newer members who are qualified from throwing their hat into the ring.</p>
    <p>Candidates will still need to convince members to vote for them. They will need other members to write statements
        to endorse them.</p>
    <p>State Council are having difficulties filling roles on key internal committees due to eligibility requirements
        tied to SC eligibility.</p>
    <p>We need to ensure that as many people as possible are engaged and empowered internally to make our governance
        more resilient.</p>
